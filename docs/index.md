# sorceress 1.7

### Purpose of package

This package's purpose is to create optical illusions in a simple way. The package is written in Python. however, the repo also includes JavaScript. In [explanations](https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/explanations%20of%20illusions/) section, you can find the explanations of the illusions.

If you find visual illusions fascinating this package is for you. You can reproduce the illusions in the literature with a few lines of code.

More importantly, we shouldn't take optical illusions as just fun. Optical illusions help us to research how the visual system of the brain ,which is the most complex mechanism, processes such cues. Most of the optical illusions in this package are seriously researched in the neuroscience literature. And I must say that the "causation" of the most of effects is still debated in the literature according to my humble knowledge. Optical illusions are researching not only in human vision but in other animals. So we can get a lot of insights from an evolutionary perspective.

In summary, I think this topic is very important, especially in vision studies.
