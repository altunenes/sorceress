Since I thought JavaScript is handier than python when it comes to animations and web deployment, I created
animations in JavaScript.
Currently, there are 4 illusions that can be seen on the page. But as you can notice, the repository has also some other js files.
These are currently in the development stage. You can open them in the browser and see the code and feel free to contribute to finishing them.

Note: The animations are not optimized for mobile devices. They are only optimized for desktops.

Finished animations :
