Currently, there are 10 illusions that can be seen on the page. But as you can notice, the repository has also some other js files.
These are currently in the development stage. You can open them in the browser and see the code and feel free to contribute to finishing them.

Note: The animations are not optimized for mobile devices. They are only optimized for desktops.
