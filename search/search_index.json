The package is written in Python. however, the repo also includes JavaScript. In explanations section, you can find the explanations of the illusions. This package contains a collection of well-known visual illusions, as well as some lesser-known ones that are just as fascinating. By using the code provided in the package, you can easily recreate the illusions and see how they work for yourself. Not only can you reproduce the illusions, but you can also experiment with them and modify the code to create your own variations. With this package, you can dive deep into the world of visual illusions and learn more about how the human brain processes visual information. Whether you're a researcher, a student, or just someone who loves illusions, this package has something for you. So if you're interested in exploring the mysteries of the human visual system, give it a try! More importantly, we shouldn't take optical illusions as just fun. Optical illusions are visual phenomena that occur when our brain interprets information from our eyes in a way that is different from reality. These illusions can reveal a lot about how our brain works and how it processes visual information, which can help us understand the underlying mechanisms of human vision. Most of the optical illusions in this package are seriously researched in the neuroscience literature. And I must say that the \"causation\" of the most of effects is still debated in the literature according to my humble knowledge. Optical illusions are researching not only in human vision but in other animals. So we can get a lot of insights from an evolutionary perspective. The difficulty of creating an optical illusion with code will depend on the specific illusion you're trying to create and your experience with coding. Some optical illusions may be relatively simple to implement, while others may be more complex and require a deeper understanding of graphics programming and the underlying principles of perception.To create an effective optical illusion, you (also me) need to understand the principles of perception and be able to use code to manipulate the visual information in a way that tricks the brain into seeing something that isn't actually there. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of perception and a lot of experimentation and trial and error to find the right combination of visual elements that creates the desired illusion. Another challenge is that creating optical illusions often requires a high level of precision and control over the visual elements in an image. This can be difficult to achieve with code, especially if you're working with complex or dynamic images that need to be updated in real time. Overall, creating optical illusions with code can be a challenging but rewarding task that requires a combination of technical skills, creativity, and an understanding of the underlying principles of perception. For all optical illusions check this documentation: altunenes.github.io/sorceress/ Getting started\ud83d\ude80\ufe0f The package can be found on PyPI hence you can install it via pip. pip install sorceress #importing from sorceress import sorceress Features For the API, click here Illusions in Python chromatic dotill realtimegrid addlines eyecolour dakinPex bruno dolboeuf kanizsa tAki2001 cafewall ccob ebbinghaus whiteill enigma blackhole colorgrids munker munker2 grids2 pareidolia spirals Illusions in JavaScript footsteps thelilac EyeMovements spatialmotion Motion Induced Blindness (2 versions) Depth Perception Speed of Rotation hypnotic circle Examples In this page , you can find all illusions, explanations, code, and how to use it.

I usually import the package like this: from sorceress import sorceress Remember you need to also install other packages, otherwise you will get an error. One of the packages is numpy , which is used to create arrays. You can install it by typing pip install numpy in your terminal. Another package is matplotlib , which is used to plot the images. You can install it by typing pip install matplotlib in your terminal. If you are using conda , you can install them by typing conda install numpy and conda install matplotlib in your terminal. If you are using pipenv , you can install them by typing pipenv install numpy and pipenv install matplotlib in your terminal. Another package is cv2, which is used to read images and image processing. You can install it by typing pip install opencv-python in your terminal. I also use imageio and PIL packages for more basic image processing. You can install them by typing pip install imageio and pip install pillow in your terminal. Last one is the color-science package, which is used to convert colors. You can install it by typing pip install color-science in your terminal. You don't need to import the other packages, because they are imported in the sorceress package. 1- chromatic Chromatic adaptation is probably one of the central concepts in color vision.It is an important factor in the perception of color. When the color of the light source changes, the brain automatically compensates for this change, which can alter the way that we perceive the colors in an image. For example, if you look at an optical illusion under different lighting conditions, it may appear to change in its intensity or color, due to the brain's ability to adapt to changes in the color of the light. Chromatic adaptation is decreased sensitivity to a particular color as a result of prolonged exposure to a colored stimulus. The chromatic adaptation transforms were mainly studied with von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and CMCCAT2000. However, CMCCAT2000 performed best. You can apply this function to any image and function automatically processes the image and returns a gif file. The gif file shows the transformation of the image from the original to the adapted image. The von Kries chromatic adaptation method is a technique that is sometimes used in camera image processing. The method is to apply a gain to each of the human cone cell spectral sensitivity responses so as to keep the adapted appearance of the reference white constant. Herbert E. Ives was the first to clearly apply Johannes von Kries' theory of adaptive gains on the three cone cell types to the issue of color constancy; as a result, the technique is sometimes known as the Ives transform or the von Kries-Ives adaptation (Gegenfurtner, 1999). sorceress.chromatic(\"inputfolder/tree.jpg\",Gifduration=10) simple example via a gif: focus on the red dot (10 second) image source 2- dotill Lateral inhibition is the phenomenon in which a neuron's response to a stimulus is inhibited by the excitation of a neighboring neuron (Bakshi and Ghosh, 2017).Neurons that are firing inhibit the stimulation of surrounding. Accordingly, only the neurons that are most stimulated and least inhibited respond (Cohen, 2011). Some neurons are activated more than others during lateral inhibition. Excitatory neurotransmitters are released to neurons along a specific path by a highly activated cell. In addition, the highly activated primary neuron in the brain activates interneurons that prevent the stimulation of cells that are located laterally. Interneurons are nerve cells that help the central nervous system and motor or sensory neurons communicate with one another. This action increases the contrast between different stimuli and sharpens the focus on a particular stimulus. Body sensory systems like the olfactory, visual, tactile, and auditory systems all experience lateral inhibition. Mach bands, the perception of light and dark lines next to abrupt brightness changes, and the gray dots that appear between junctions in the Hermann grid illusion can all be explained by lateral inhibition. It's an old-fashioned illusion that is probably known the most. I've added many parameters to this function to reproduce in distinctive ways. example usage: sorceress.dotill((500,500),hlinefreq=12,wlinefreq=12,dotcolor=(0,255,0),dotradius=5,horizontalcolor=(14, 75, 3),verticalcolor=(14, 75, 3),horizontalthickness=4,verticalthickness=4,verticallines=True,horizontallines=True): 3- sorceress.realtimegrid() sorceress.realtimegrid(realcolours=True) perceive black and white real time (with webcam) frames as colorful. It's a real time version of sorceress.colorgrids() function. with realcolours=False code will not calculate the real colors of your frame. I recommend you to use this function with real colors. Illusion is getting powerful if colors of lines separate each other, however, with realcolours=False means a lot of options are needed in the slide bar and it's not a pleasant view. It is an indicator of how flexible the color perception in the human visual system is. Inspiration : 4- addlines inspired from prof Akiyoshi Kitaoka. Have you seen this illusion before? In the below, someone is hiding after those grids. Beneath these grids there is more than Grids. Beneath these grids there is an idea. And ideas are bulletproof... What you see is results of vast amounts of neural computation, mixed with a bit of guesswork. If you look closely you use lower spatial frequencies and if you look at a further distance you will see the high spatial frequencies. In short, there are more grids that fall on the light-sensitive portion of the back of your eye the further the image is away from you.Low-contrast object perception is impaired by high spatial-frequency components. You can see the Vendetta guy if you scroll down and up the page or zoom out the whole image. Or more accurately, apply a Gaussian. sorceress.addlines(img,linecolour1=(0,255,0),linecolour2=(0,255,255),linecolour3=(255,0,0)) This function basically adds vertical lines to an image, but it's blending not overlaying! img your input image like \"morgo.jpg\" linecolour1 linecolour2 and linecolour3 are point the colors of lines. example usage: sorceress.addlines(\"vfor.jpg\",linecolour1=(150,5,5),linecolour2=(10,155,20),linecolour3=(0,15,15),alphablending==False) If you select alphablending==True line colors are much more stable against the luminance change in the background image. It's because in OpenCV when you overlay two images or colors the function called addWeighted mixes the colors in very \"small tones\" but you probably do not even notice. Still, this function which I called alpha blending, is much more stable to luminance change. Use both, in the same way, and see what differs. 5- eyecolour inspried from m.bach: eyecolour(\"yourimage.jpg\") #best results: eyecolour(\"galadriel2.jpg\",alpha=0.9,beta=0.5,M=1,luminance=1,saturation=1,colors=(0,0,255) With this illusion, you perceive the black-and-white NumPy array as colorful. After you run this code, you need to select the iris manually and then push the enter. I didn't want to use the iris detector since it slowed down the script. Just select smaller as much as possible. I've used seamlessClone function from OpenCV for getting much more realistic results. Your ROI (region of interest that you selected manually) will correspond to an eclipse' coordinates which I needed to detect the exact position of the iris. Red, green, and blue are three overlapping color families that three separate types of photoreceptors in the eye are tuned to, which contributes to the process of seeing color (which are activated by visible light of long, medium and short wavelengths). Then, in the same scenario, these signals are immediately compared with signals from surrounding places. The comparison process continues as the signals move up the brain's hierarchy of processing centers, where they are compared to ever-larger portions of the environment. Accordingly, color and brightness are always relative due to this \"opponent process.\" I must say that this illusion is very sensitive to the brightness values of the image you will use. And you should use an image that you can center exactly. example: You probably have seen this lady's left eye as blue, but it's exactly the same color as the right eye. Use images that have a similar face structure and brightness values (luminance). In next version, I will add a parameter to adjust the luminance of the image. 6- dakinPexc sorceress.dakinPex(outputname=\"myoutput\",dimension=800) If you see the different tones of gray this illusion is successful. If you perceive all same, try with the big dimensions. I've written this illusion after the read a paper from (Dakin and Bex, 2003). The existence of spatial frequency channels in the visual system is implicated in lightness perception. And I also should note that It has long been known that the brightness of a region of visual space is not related only to that region\u2019s luminance, but depends also upon the luminances of adjacent regions (Von Bekesy, 1968). 7- bruno bruno(outputname,circle=False,polycolor=(0, 255, 255), rectcolor=(255, 255, 0), circColor=(0, 0, 255)) sorceress.sorcerer.bruno(\"myimagee\",polycolor=(0,0,255),rectcolor=(34,34,128)) Well at first time it seems a little bit confusing but in their experiments, Bruno et al. (1997) have shown their participants first the shapes that you've seen on the left then the shapes on the right have shown. In this experiment, participants needed to decide quickly as much as possible whether is it the same or not with the previous shape that they had shown. Results have shown that participants were fast and found it easy to say that the two shapes were the same in the top situation. But they were very slow in the other scenario (It's still the same!). 8- dolboeuf dolboeuf(outputname,circleColor=(0,0,255),kill=False) sorceress.dolboeuf(\"doloeufout\",kill=False) Which red circle is bigger than the other? Probably you know what I'm talking about, two of them in the same radius. This illusion was first created by Belgian psychologist Joseph Remi Leopold Delb\u0153uf in 1865. It's all about the perception of size. Of course, it's not the \"all\" about the story, the size differences of the inner and outer circles also play their roles in this illusion... Well, I didn't create a parameter for customizing those circles' (inner and outer) radius but I believe you get the point. If you select the kill=True , the illusion will be destroyed by the two horizontal lines. 9- kanizsa kanizsa(outputname,dims,circleColor=(0,0,255)) sorceress.kanizsa(\"12outkaniza\",400,circleColor=(34,34,178)) The Kanizsa illusion is probably one of the most known it was created by an Italian psychologist Gaetano Kanizsa (1913\u20131993). We can see surfaces, in this example squares (even though there are different kinds of Kanizas), with contours that are not present in the image. It is called illusory contours you can call this illusion also the \"subjective contours\" (Kanizsa, 1976). The first time I heard the name \"Kanizsa\" I thought he is Japanese for a long time. Then I learned that Kaniza was actually an Italian! It's because his name is used in many psychology textbooks to describe the Kanizsa triangle and most of those books don't give the full name of Kanizsa. The illusion is thought to be caused by the way that the brain processes information about shapes and figures. When we look at an image, our brains automatically try to organize the visual information into recognizable patterns and shapes, and in the case of the Kanizsa squares, the brain is tricked into perceiving a square where none actually exists. 10- ponzol ponzol(outputname,kill=False,line1=(255,0,0),line2=(255,0,0),rectangle1=(0,0,255),rectangle2=(0,0,255)) sorceress.ponzol(\"test\",kill=False,line1=(0,0,139),line2=(0,0,139),rectangle1=(0,69,255),rectangle2=(0,80,255)) The Ponzo illusion is old (Ponzo, 1912). But Ponzo actually published his illusion with a scientific paper. Actually, any image with a strong sense of perspective has this. You could see various methods if you search a little bit (especially in railways). The Ponzo illusion is an example of how the brain uses information about depth and perspective to perceive the world around us, and it shows how the brain can be fooled by optical illusions. 11- tAki2001 sorceress.tAki2001(outputname, dimension=700, circlecolour=(0, 255, 255), circleradius=15, bglinecolor=(255, 128, 128),bgcolor=(255, 255, 255)) #example usage: sorceress.tAki2001(\"YelowRay\",dimension=1200) \u201cColoured ray illusion \u201d by Akiyoshi Kitaoka (Kitaoka, 2001). There were similar kinds of illusions that have been described by other scientists like Prandtl,(1927). Illusory yellow circles appear to run obliquely over the homogeneously white background. I added to function to change the background in the BGR array. Try it with other background colors with bgcolor parameter. 12-cafewall sorceress.cafeWall(outputname, dimension=1200, resize=False, brickcolor=(255, 255, 255), bgcolor=(0, 0, 0)) #example: sorceress.cafeWall(\"myimage\",1200,resize=True,brickcolor=(0,0,128),bgcolor=(114,128,254)) This is maybe one of the most strong optical illusions that have ever been created. Bricks create a pattern in which the mortar lines between them do not look parallel. Why do we call it a \"cafe wall\"? well, a student of Richard Gregory from the University of Bristol has noticed this from a caf\u00e9 (on St Michael\u2019s Hill). The illusion is strongest when the mortar has a brightness that is in between that of the two tiles. So illusion will be work as long as colors have different brightness. Why we are seeing this? Well, the only scientific explanation that I've known is from Gregory and Heard (1979). The role of orientation-sensitive simple cells in V1 and reactions to luminance borders are mainly involved in this illusion as they've mentioned. Gregory and Heard (1979) proposed that regions of varying luminances be retained in the spatial register by locking their borders. This border-locking technique causes inadvertent contour alterations between sections separated by small gaps. They've also shown that illusion disappears if the luminance of the middle line is noticeably lower or higher than the luminance of the two types of squares. 13-ccob #usage sorceress.ccob(\"aki.jpg\",rms=0.5,amplitudespectrum=300,plttitle=\"myoutput\") The signs with the letters R inside are the same color! This one is probably the most math-required optical illusion in this package. \ud83d\ude04 First why do I call it \"ccob\" it stands for \"Craik\u2013Cornsweet\u2013O'Brien\" and is commonly called as CCOB effect. The illusion is the same sorceress.sorcerer.dakinPexc() . This illusion is taken as evidence for a low\u2013level \u2018filling\u2013in\u2019 mechanism subserving lightness perception. How do I create this illusion? Well, it's about the spatial frequency filtering with Fourier transform. But what is spatial freuqency? Spatial frequency is a measure of how much detail is in an image or a pattern. Low spatial frequency means that there is not much detail in the image, and it looks blurry or fuzzy. High spatial frequency means that there is a lot of detail in the image, and it looks sharp and clear. Imagine that you are looking at a picture of a tree. If the picture has low spatial frequency, it might look like a big green blob with no branches or leaves. This is because there is not much detail in the picture, and it is hard to see the different parts of the tree. On the other hand, if the picture has high spatial frequency, you would be able to see all of the branches and leaves on the tree, and it would look much more like a real tree. And this illusion is mostly stimulus-oriented, so be sure your input image has some big luminance differences and does not have too much roughness. The function is converting your image to grayscale first then scaling to -1 +1. Then RMS which is the standard deviation of a measure of image contrast, also known as \u201croot means square\u201d, the contrast has been adjusting. The most important part is the amplitude spectrum. You can either apply a low or high pass filter it depends on your input image. Finally, to minimize coarse changes in luminance, the function applies a Laplacian-of-Gaussians (LoG) filter. If you look close enough to the edges of the domains you may see some \"ringing\". This is the result of the discrete Fourier transform. The image that've shown image has been taken from the A. Kitaoka's twitter account. Here, I would like to show another example with another input image: sorceress.ccob(\"kaniza.png\",rms=0.2,amplitudespectrum=300,plttitle=\"myoutput2\") Above the color of the circles and the surface is the same. Try yourself with different amplitude spectrum and RMS values. 14-ebbinghaus sorceress.ebbinghaus(\"output\",bgcolor=(0,255,255),lcradius=22,rcradius=22) It looks simple, but the creating process of this illusion is about trigonometry \ud83d\ude04. The illusion called Ebbinghaus Illusion is similar to the Delb\u0153uf illusion. In both illusions, the size of an object is affected by the surrounding context. As you can see at the above bot circles has 22 radius. You also can change the outer circles' radius. If you have psychology major like me you probably heard a lot the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, especially in the introduction courses. We know his popular work about the memory. The illusion is widely replicated in psychology literature with different contexts (Aglioti et al, 1995; Lee and van Donkelaar, 2002; Culham et al, 2003). For example, In Aglioti's study, the direct comparison led to an approximately 50% increase of the illusion, which corresponds well to the difference found between perception and grasping. These researchers replaced the inner circular image with a tiny poker-chip-like token in their research. When asked to estimate the size of the target tokens, the subjects displayed the illusion throughout the trial, but when asked to manually pick up the central target token, the illusion had a considerably less impact on manual grip size during the grasping process. This was seen to indicate that the ventral system is influenced by the illusion and the dorsal system is not. The findings have been replicated by Haffenden and Goodale (1998). 15-whiteill sorceress.whiteill(dimension=300,version2=False,rect1=(92,92,255),rect2=(47,255,173),outputname=\"whiteillout\") This is another strong illusion that has been described by White (1979). As you can see above, although the inner rectangles have in same gray ((128,128,128)) scale we perceive it in different contrast. It is hard to believe that two grey patches are the same when they look so different. You may also perceive the \"lighter one\" as larger but it's another part of the illusion which was described first by Galileo Galilei (1632) as the \"irradiation effect\". This function has also different various of this illusion you may call with the version2=True that shown like the bellow: sorceress.whiteill(version2=True,outputname=\"whiteillout\") Do I need to say grays are the same? \ud83d\ude04. The scientific explanations are still debated in the literature at first look. A recent study about White's study (Betz et al., 2015) found that the illusion was marginally enhanced by contour adaptation at the test patch edges parallel to the grating. The contrasting behavior seen in the current investigation in response to independent manipulations of collinear or flanking bar luminance is consistent with these findings. Before White identified this phenomenon, it was believed that all brightness illusions were the consequence of rival processes, meaning that a gray item should appear dark when surrounded by light and light when surrounded by darkness. However, in this deception, the darker-appearing gray bars are surrounded by black stimuli whereas the lighter-appearing gray bars are surrounded by white stimuli. As I said before, White's effect's underlying neural mechanisms are still a mystery. Imagine that you are looking at a picture with a white dog on a black background. The cells in your eyes that help you see the white dog will send a message to your brain saying \"white dog!\" But the cells that help you see the black background will also send a message to your brain saying \"not white dog!\" The second message helps your brain understand that the white dog is standing out from the black background, and makes the white dog look even whiter. This is lateral inhibition. It helps your brain see the differences between things, like white and black. 16-footsteps Ok since this is not part of our python package I have not listed it as a function. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/footsteps: . I also added source codes of the js, you can find it under the \"javascripts\" folder. The footsteps illusion is a motion illusion in which objects appear to move fast or slow even when they move at the same speed. With the link that I share with you above you can the speed and the adjusted colors in the same. In this version, I've added a small red rectangle in the middle. After you adjust colors in the same range (choose colors that have high contrast!) and slow down the animation speed focus to the middle rectangle now it looks like moving back and forth. The key point of explanation of this illusion is the brightness differences. Between the moving objects and the background is important for the explanation of this illusion (Anstis, 2003). 17-thelilac The Lilac chaser illusion is a visual illusion described by Jeremy L. Hinton in 2005 and was shown by Michael Bach on his website of the same year. For the best results, using a pinkish-violet color is a good choice, but other colors can also be used; in our animation, we'll use two different colors in two concentric rings. I also added a blur section which makes the stronger effect. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/thelilac: . I added various methods so you can use different combinations. 18-EyeMovements sorceress/EyeMovements: This illusion is quite interesting actually, when I first saw this illusion I immediately thought of the footstep illusion. It works in very similar. You can read the whole Twitter thread for the comments of its original creators. twitter/Ben Balas: I've customized this illusion with different conditions but I highly recommend the blur section. If you increase the blur of the screen the illusion is much stronger than you've realized. 20-Enigma enigma(linecolors=(255,255,255), bgcolor=(1, 1, 1),circle1=(76, 0, 153),circle2=(102, 0, 204),centercircle=(0,255,255), outputname=\"enigma\"): ` Fixation of the centre will result in the perception of rotatory motion in the circles. This illusion based on the a paper from the Zeki et al (1993). In their paper, they have shown that human V5 which basically responsible for the perception of motion, even there is no real motion, can be active with such illusions. So they concluded that activity in a visual area devoted to visual motion might be expected to correlate with the perception of motion, even if there is no real motion. When the two colors of circles are equiluminant and the only clues to the existence of moving stripes are color differences, the perception of motion is greatly diminished. These alterations are linked to V5 activity. And I also would like to remind you that the illusion may not work for everyone, there are individual differences. 21-blackhole sorceress.blackhole(outputname=\"blackhole\",height=800, width=800, circle_size=10, circle_color=(0, 0, 0),kill=False) This is a recent optical illusion that was described by Laeng et al (2022). According to the paper, the change rates of pupil diameters were significantly related to the illusory motion phenomenology only with the black holes. You can try it with the other colors though. \"The findings demonstrate that the reflex to dilate or contract the pupils is not a closed-loop system, like a photocell opening a door, that is only sensitive to the amount of light stimulating the photoreceptor. Instead of just adjusting to real energy, the eye may also respond to perceived and even imagined light.\" The illusion appeared most effective when the hole was black. However, I added many parameters so you can try different colors. 22-colorgrids If you look closely enough you will see the original image is black and white. However, via colorful stripes your brain into seeing a color image. Basically, our brain is trying to fill the gaps between the stripes and it gives us an overall impression of what's there. You can call the function like this: sorceress.colorgrids(\"inputfolder/test.jpg\",\"grids\",frequency=24) Inspiration, \u00d8yvind Kol\u00e5s : 23-Motion It's a very interesting illusion. I've seen it in a paper that was recently published (Brenner & Smeets, 2022) According to this paper when two dots move clockwise or counterclockwise along the circular path, the one dots clearly moves faster than the other one. However, they are at the same speed. I added different conditions to reproduce this illusion in different ways. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/Motion: 24-blindness Motion Induced Blindness (MIB) is a phenomenon of visual disappearance or perceptual illusions observed in the lab, in which stationary visual stimuli disappear as if erased in front of an observer's eyes when masked with a moving background. This illusion is thought to be caused by the way that the brain processes visual information. When we look at a scene, our brains automatically focus on the moving objects, while ignoring the stationary ones. This is because our brains are designed to track moving objects, as they are often potential threats or sources of food. In the case of motion-induced blindness, the brain becomes so focused on the moving objects that it fails to register the stationary object, causing it to disappear from view. This is why the stationary object appears to \"disappear\" in the midst of all the moving objects. With this illusion, you can see the disappearance of the objects in front of your eyes. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/blindness: I added different conditions, \"add circle\" button adds circles to the screen and you can adjust their positions with your mouse interactively. You can also change the fixation cross with your mouse, + and - buttons change the speed of the moving background. In addition, I programmed the another version of this illusion it works with same principles but it's a bit different. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/blindness2: Use \"add circle\" button to add circles to the screen and you can adjust their positions with your mouse interactively. In this demonstration the observer focuses at the flickering green dot in the middle. After about 10 seconds, the observer sees one, two or all three of the static yellow dots arranged at the corners of an imaginary equilateral triangle disappear and then reappear. 25-Depth Our visual system is very good at estimating the depth of objects in the world. However, it's not perfect. Being able to view the world in three dimensions is known as depth perception. In order to perceive depth, we must also be able to determine how far away an item is from us. Our perception of an object's size and distance depends on the size and proximity of other items. For me, there is an incredibly strong depth illusion. Even though in 2D the squares are the same size, same color, and same distance but our brain creates a perception of depth. It's because of the borders of the squares, moreover if you animate you may also see a motion illusion. You can access this illusion from here, play with the parameters and see what happens Web demo 26-Munker Above you can see 3 different colored circles. However, all circles actually have the same color RGB(255,255,255). Stripes are added to the circles to create the illusion of different colors. Actually, this illusion is not called \"Munker\" but it's very similar to the Munker illusion. It's also a different version of the colorgrids illusion. It's because, we have greater shape perception than color acuity, which indicates that we detect shapes in greater detail and colors in less detail. As a result, even if the spheres' contours are all similar, the color \"kind of bleeds over, or assimilates, to adjacent regions (Novick & Kitaoka, 2021). The paper that I added in the references section has a very detailed explanation. I didn't want to adjust ratios to give more freedom to the user. So, you can adjust the parameters and see what happens. In this version, dimensions are optimized for square shapes so you may see some distortions if you use rectangular shapes. Below you can see the 1200x1200 version of the illusion. I would like to also thank Fred Weinhaus , a hero of image processing, for helping me to code this illusion. I was trying to code this illusion in a very hard way, using hough transform, detecting the edges, and certain colors, and applying some ugly trigonometric functions. However, Fred recommended me \"why you just don't mask the circles\". I was like \"oh, that's a good idea\". So, I coded this illusion in a very easy way. You can check the whole story in stackoverflow here . 27-Munker2 This is a different version of the Munker illusion. The effect is the same but it's rectangular. You can adjust the parameters and see what happens. Above, the two rectangles have the same color but they have different stripe colors. But you may perceive them as different colors. 28-Pareidolia Face pareidolia is a phenomenon in which people see faces in random objects. Pareidolia is the phenomenon of perceiving a pattern or meaning where none exists. It is a type of illusion, and it is thought to be a result of the brain's tendency to try to make sense of random or ambiguous stimuli. Our brains are constantly bombarded with sensory information, and they are very good at organizing and interpreting this information in a way that makes sense to us. Sometimes, however, our brains can interpret random or meaningless stimuli as being meaningful, which can result in pareidolia. For example, if you see a cloud that looks like a face, your brain may interpret it as a face even though it is just a random arrangement of water droplets. This is because your brain is trying to make sense of the information it is receiving, and it is using its knowledge of faces to do so. I have created this illusion accidentally. I was trying to create a Gabor patch and I was trying to add some noise to the image with Gabor coefficients. But I saw a face while I working on it. So I re-designed the code and add into the sorceress :) 29-Grids2 Above, there are little circles for each corner of the squares. However, when you fix your gaze on an area you will see the other circles disappears. It looks like the Herman grid illusion. But I'm not sure if it's the same. 30-Length Okay, first of all, I m not sure if this is an illusion or not. The idea emerged after reading a paper from (Anstis et al., 2006). After I read this paper, I thought maybe sorceress/Motion: illusion somehow could have a similar effect. So, I added stripes on the background and a line that routed clockwise. Speed and length are constant. The question is do you feel any difference between with background stripes and without background stripes? For me, I feel the line is growing longer when I look at the stripes. Try demo here You can adjust the length and speed of the line. 31-Spirals Above, there are only 3 different colors, blue, magenta, and green. However, you may see different shades of green. It looks like a Munker illusion. The mechanism of the Munker illusion involves both a color-assimilation effect and a contrast effect (Novick & Kitaoka, 2021). I actually \"translated\" this code from GLSL language into python. But I wish I could do it in a better way since it's a bit slow with heavy math in the background. 32-Hypnotic Circles I inspired this effect from a video by brusspup . However, when I search for the video I found the illusion was actually created by Arthur Shapiro and Alex Rose-Henig unfortunately I couldn't find the original paper. Circles within a larger black circle (actually I coded it into a rectangle). The inner circles in turn seem to form a circular shape that's rolling around the inside of the larger circle. But, believe it or not, the direction that each circle is linear, not circular. You can try the demo here To me, after 5 circles the illusion is starting. Increasing or decreasing the radius of the circles or animation speed didn't affect my perception. However, you can try it and see what happens. ``` REFERENCES Aglioti S, DeSouza JFX, Goodale MA (1995) Size-contrast illusions deceive the eye but not the hand.

When the color of the light source changes, the brain automatically compensates for this change, which can alter the way that we perceive the colors in an image. For example, if you look at an optical illusion under different lighting conditions, it may appear to change in its intensity or color, due to the brain's ability to adapt to changes in the color of the light. Chromatic adaptation is decreased sensitivity to a particular color as a result of prolonged exposure to a colored stimulus. The chromatic adaptation transforms were mainly studied with von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and CMCCAT2000. However, CMCCAT2000 performed best. You can apply this function to any image and function automatically processes the image and returns a gif file. The gif file shows the transformation of the image from the original to the adapted image. The von Kries chromatic adaptation method is a technique that is sometimes used in camera image processing. The method is to apply a gain to each of the human cone cell spectral sensitivity responses so as to keep the adapted appearance of the reference white constant. Herbert E. Ives was the first to clearly apply Johannes von Kries' theory of adaptive gains on the three cone cell types to the issue of color constancy; as a result, the technique is sometimes known as the Ives transform or the von Kries-Ives adaptation (Gegenfurtner, 1999). sorceress.chromatic(\"inputfolder/tree.jpg\",Gifduration=10) simple example via a gif: focus on the red dot (10 second) image source","title":"1- chromatic"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#2-dotill","text":"Lateral inhibition is the phenomenon in which a neuron's response to a stimulus is inhibited by the excitation of a neighboring neuron (Bakshi and Ghosh, 2017).Neurons that are firing inhibit the stimulation of surrounding. Accordingly, only the neurons that are most stimulated and least inhibited respond (Cohen, 2011). Some neurons are activated more than others during lateral inhibition. Excitatory neurotransmitters are released to neurons along a specific path by a highly activated cell. In addition, the highly activated primary neuron in the brain activates interneurons that prevent the stimulation of cells that are located laterally. Interneurons are nerve cells that help the central nervous system and motor or sensory neurons communicate with one another. This action increases the contrast between different stimuli and sharpens the focus on a particular stimulus. Body sensory systems like the olfactory, visual, tactile, and auditory systems all experience lateral inhibition. Mach bands, the perception of light and dark lines next to abrupt brightness changes, and the gray dots that appear between junctions in the Hermann grid illusion can all be explained by lateral inhibition. It's an old-fashioned illusion that is probably known the most. I've added many parameters to this function to reproduce in distinctive ways. example usage: sorceress.dotill((500,500),hlinefreq=12,wlinefreq=12,dotcolor=(0,255,0),dotradius=5,horizontalcolor=(14, 75, 3),verticalcolor=(14, 75, 3),horizontalthickness=4,verticalthickness=4,verticallines=True,horizontallines=True): 3- sorceress.realtimegrid() sorceress.realtimegrid(realcolours=True) perceive black and white real time (with webcam) frames as colorful.

Illusion is getting powerful if colors of lines separate each other, however, with realcolours=False means a lot of options are needed in the slide bar and it's not a pleasant view. It is an indicator of how flexible the color perception in the human visual system is.

In the below, someone is hiding after those grids. Beneath these grids there is more than Grids. Beneath these grids there is an idea. And ideas are bulletproof... What you see is results of vast amounts of neural computation, mixed with a bit of guesswork. If you look closely you use lower spatial frequencies and if you look at a further distance you will see the high spatial frequencies. In short, there are more grids that fall on the light-sensitive portion of the back of your eye the further the image is away from you.Low-contrast object perception is impaired by high spatial-frequency components. You can see the Vendetta guy if you scroll down and up the page or zoom out the whole image. Or more accurately, apply a Gaussian. sorceress.addlines(img,linecolour1=(0,255,0),linecolour2=(0,255,255),linecolour3=(255,0,0)) This function basically adds vertical lines to an image, but it's blending not overlaying! img your input image like \"morgo.jpg\" linecolour1 linecolour2 and linecolour3 are point the colors of lines. example usage: sorceress.addlines(\"vfor.jpg\",linecolour1=(150,5,5),linecolour2=(10,155,20),linecolour3=(0,15,15),alphablending==False) If you select alphablending==True line colors are much more stable against the luminance change in the background image. It's because in OpenCV when you overlay two images or colors the function called addWeighted mixes the colors in very \"small tones\" but you probably do not even notice. Still, this function which I called alpha blending, is much more stable to luminance change. Use both, in the same way, and see what differs.","title":"4- addlines"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#5-eyecolour","text":"inspried from m.bach: eyecolour(\"yourimage.jpg\") #best results: eyecolour(\"galadriel2.jpg\",alpha=0.9,beta=0.5,M=1,luminance=1,saturation=1,colors=(0,0,255) With this illusion, you perceive the black-and-white NumPy array as colorful. After you run this code, you need to select the iris manually and then push the enter. I didn't want to use the iris detector since it slowed down the script. Just select smaller as much as possible. I've used seamlessClone function from OpenCV for getting much more realistic results. Your ROI (region of interest that you selected manually) will correspond to an eclipse' coordinates which I needed to detect the exact position of the iris. Red, green, and blue are three overlapping color families that three separate types of photoreceptors in the eye are tuned to, which contributes to the process of seeing color (which are activated by visible light of long, medium and short wavelengths). Then, in the same scenario, these signals are immediately compared with signals from surrounding places. The comparison process continues as the signals move up the brain's hierarchy of processing centers, where they are compared to ever-larger portions of the environment. Accordingly, color and brightness are always relative due to this \"opponent process.\" I must say that this illusion is very sensitive to the brightness values of the image you will use. And you should use an image that you can center exactly. example: You probably have seen this lady's left eye as blue, but it's exactly the same color as the right eye. Use images that have a similar face structure and brightness values (luminance).

We can see surfaces, in this example squares (even though there are different kinds of Kanizas), with contours that are not present in the image. It is called illusory contours you can call this illusion also the \"subjective contours\" (Kanizsa, 1976). The first time I heard the name \"Kanizsa\" I thought he is Japanese for a long time. Then I learned that Kaniza was actually an Italian! It's because his name is used in many psychology textbooks to describe the Kanizsa triangle and most of those books don't give the full name of Kanizsa. The illusion is thought to be caused by the way that the brain processes information about shapes and figures. When we look at an image, our brains automatically try to organize the visual information into recognizable patterns and shapes, and in the case of the Kanizsa squares, the brain is tricked into perceiving a square where none actually exists.","title":"9- kanizsa"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#10-ponzol","text":"ponzol(outputname,kill=False,line1=(255,0,0),line2=(255,0,0),rectangle1=(0,0,255),rectangle2=(0,0,255)) sorceress.ponzol(\"test\",kill=False,line1=(0,0,139),line2=(0,0,139),rectangle1=(0,69,255),rectangle2=(0,80,255)) The Ponzo illusion is old (Ponzo, 1912). But Ponzo actually published his illusion with a scientific paper. Actually, any image with a strong sense of perspective has this.

Bricks create a pattern in which the mortar lines between them do not look parallel. Why do we call it a \"cafe wall\"? well, a student of Richard Gregory from the University of Bristol has noticed this from a caf\u00e9 (on St Michael\u2019s Hill). The illusion is strongest when the mortar has a brightness that is in between that of the two tiles. So illusion will be work as long as colors have different brightness. Why we are seeing this? Well, the only scientific explanation that I've known is from Gregory and Heard (1979). The role of orientation-sensitive simple cells in V1 and reactions to luminance borders are mainly involved in this illusion as they've mentioned. Gregory and Heard (1979) proposed that regions of varying luminances be retained in the spatial register by locking their borders. This border-locking technique causes inadvertent contour alterations between sections separated by small gaps. They've also shown that illusion disappears if the luminance of the middle line is noticeably lower or higher than the luminance of the two types of squares.","title":"12-cafewall"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#13-ccob","text":"#usage sorceress.ccob(\"aki.jpg\",rms=0.5,amplitudespectrum=300,plttitle=\"myoutput\") The signs with the letters R inside are the same color!

The illusion is the same sorceress.sorcerer.dakinPexc() . This illusion is taken as evidence for a low\u2013level \u2018filling\u2013in\u2019 mechanism subserving lightness perception. How do I create this illusion? Well, it's about the spatial frequency filtering with Fourier transform. But what is spatial freuqency? Spatial frequency is a measure of how much detail is in an image or a pattern. Low spatial frequency means that there is not much detail in the image, and it looks blurry or fuzzy. High spatial frequency means that there is a lot of detail in the image, and it looks sharp and clear. Imagine that you are looking at a picture of a tree. If the picture has low spatial frequency, it might look like a big green blob with no branches or leaves. This is because there is not much detail in the picture, and it is hard to see the different parts of the tree. On the other hand, if the picture has high spatial frequency, you would be able to see all of the branches and leaves on the tree, and it would look much more like a real tree. And this illusion is mostly stimulus-oriented, so be sure your input image has some big luminance differences and does not have too much roughness. The function is converting your image to grayscale first then scaling to -1 +1. Then RMS which is the standard deviation of a measure of image contrast, also known as \u201croot means square\u201d, the contrast has been adjusting. The most important part is the amplitude spectrum. You can either apply a low or high pass filter it depends on your input image. Finally, to minimize coarse changes in luminance, the function applies a Laplacian-of-Gaussians (LoG) filter. If you look close enough to the edges of the domains you may see some \"ringing\". This is the result of the discrete Fourier transform. The image that've shown image has been taken from the A. Kitaoka's twitter account. Here, I would like to show another example with another input image: sorceress.ccob(\"kaniza.png\",rms=0.2,amplitudespectrum=300,plttitle=\"myoutput2\") Above the color of the circles and the surface is the same.

The illusion called Ebbinghaus Illusion is similar to the Delb\u0153uf illusion. In both illusions, the size of an object is affected by the surrounding context. As you can see at the above bot circles has 22 radius. You also can change the outer circles' radius. If you have psychology major like me you probably heard a lot the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, especially in the introduction courses. We know his popular work about the memory. The illusion is widely replicated in psychology literature with different contexts (Aglioti et al, 1995; Lee and van Donkelaar, 2002; Culham et al, 2003). For example, In Aglioti's study, the direct comparison led to an approximately 50% increase of the illusion, which corresponds well to the difference found between perception and grasping. These researchers replaced the inner circular image with a tiny poker-chip-like token in their research. When asked to estimate the size of the target tokens, the subjects displayed the illusion throughout the trial, but when asked to manually pick up the central target token, the illusion had a considerably less impact on manual grip size during the grasping process. This was seen to indicate that the ventral system is influenced by the illusion and the dorsal system is not. The findings have been replicated by Haffenden and Goodale (1998).","title":"14-ebbinghaus"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#15-whiteill","text":"sorceress.whiteill(dimension=300,version2=False,rect1=(92,92,255),rect2=(47,255,173),outputname=\"whiteillout\") This is another strong illusion that has been described by White (1979). As you can see above, although the inner rectangles have in same gray ((128,128,128)) scale we perceive it in different contrast. It is hard to believe that two grey patches are the same when they look so different. You may also perceive the \"lighter one\" as larger but it's another part of the illusion which was described first by Galileo Galilei (1632) as the \"irradiation effect\". This function has also different various of this illusion you may call with the version2=True that shown like the bellow: sorceress.whiteill(version2=True,outputname=\"whiteillout\") Do I need to say grays are the same? \ud83d\ude04. The scientific explanations are still debated in the literature at first look. A recent study about White's study (Betz et al., 2015) found that the illusion was marginally enhanced by contour adaptation at the test patch edges parallel to the grating. The contrasting behavior seen in the current investigation in response to independent manipulations of collinear or flanking bar luminance is consistent with these findings. Before White identified this phenomenon, it was believed that all brightness illusions were the consequence of rival processes, meaning that a gray item should appear dark when surrounded by light and light when surrounded by darkness. However, in this deception, the darker-appearing gray bars are surrounded by black stimuli whereas the lighter-appearing gray bars are surrounded by white stimuli. As I said before, White's effect's underlying neural mechanisms are still a mystery. Imagine that you are looking at a picture with a white dog on a black background. The cells in your eyes that help you see the white dog will send a message to your brain saying \"white dog!\" But the cells that help you see the black background will also send a message to your brain saying \"not white dog!\" The second message helps your brain understand that the white dog is standing out from the black background, and makes the white dog look even whiter. This is lateral inhibition. It helps your brain see the differences between things, like white and black.","title":"15-whiteill"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#16-footsteps","text":"Ok since this is not part of our python package I have not listed it as a function.

When we look at a scene, our brains automatically focus on the moving objects, while ignoring the stationary ones. This is because our brains are designed to track moving objects, as they are often potential threats or sources of food. In the case of motion-induced blindness, the brain becomes so focused on the moving objects that it fails to register the stationary object, causing it to disappear from view. This is why the stationary object appears to \"disappear\" in the midst of all the moving objects. With this illusion, you can see the disappearance of the objects in front of your eyes. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/blindness: I added different conditions, \"add circle\" button adds circles to the screen and you can adjust their positions with your mouse interactively. You can also change the fixation cross with your mouse, + and - buttons change the speed of the moving background. In addition, I programmed the another version of this illusion it works with same principles but it's a bit different. You can access this illusion from here sorceress/blindness2: Use \"add circle\" button to add circles to the screen and you can adjust their positions with your mouse interactively. In this demonstration the observer focuses at the flickering green dot in the middle. After about 10 seconds, the observer sees one, two or all three of the static yellow dots arranged at the corners of an imaginary equilateral triangle disappear and then reappear.","title":"24-blindness"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#25-depth","text":"Our visual system is very good at estimating the depth of objects in the world. However, it's not perfect. Being able to view the world in three dimensions is known as depth perception. In order to perceive depth, we must also be able to determine how far away an item is from us. Our perception of an object's size and distance depends on the size and proximity of other items. For me, there is an incredibly strong depth illusion. Even though in 2D the squares are the same size, same color, and same distance but our brain creates a perception of depth. It's because of the borders of the squares, moreover if you animate you may also see a motion illusion.

However, all circles actually have the same color RGB(255,255,255). Stripes are added to the circles to create the illusion of different colors. Actually, this illusion is not called \"Munker\" but it's very similar to the Munker illusion. It's also a different version of the colorgrids illusion. It's because, we have greater shape perception than color acuity, which indicates that we detect shapes in greater detail and colors in less detail. As a result, even if the spheres' contours are all similar, the color \"kind of bleeds over, or assimilates, to adjacent regions (Novick & Kitaoka, 2021). The paper that I added in the references section has a very detailed explanation. I didn't want to adjust ratios to give more freedom to the user. So, you can adjust the parameters and see what happens. In this version, dimensions are optimized for square shapes so you may see some distortions if you use rectangular shapes. Below you can see the 1200x1200 version of the illusion. I would like to also thank Fred Weinhaus , a hero of image processing, for helping me to code this illusion. I was trying to code this illusion in a very hard way, using hough transform, detecting the edges, and certain colors, and applying some ugly trigonometric functions. However, Fred recommended me \"why you just don't mask the circles\". I was like \"oh, that's a good idea\". So, I coded this illusion in a very easy way. You can check the whole story in stackoverflow here .","title":"26-Munker"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#27-munker2","text":"This is a different version of the Munker illusion. The effect is the same but it's rectangular. You can adjust the parameters and see what happens. Above, the two rectangles have the same color but they have different stripe colors. But you may perceive them as different colors.","title":"27-Munker2"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#28-pareidolia","text":"Face pareidolia is a phenomenon in which people see faces in random objects. Pareidolia is the phenomenon of perceiving a pattern or meaning where none exists. It is a type of illusion, and it is thought to be a result of the brain's tendency to try to make sense of random or ambiguous stimuli. Our brains are constantly bombarded with sensory information, and they are very good at organizing and interpreting this information in a way that makes sense to us. Sometimes, however, our brains can interpret random or meaningless stimuli as being meaningful, which can result in pareidolia. For example, if you see a cloud that looks like a face, your brain may interpret it as a face even though it is just a random arrangement of water droplets. This is because your brain is trying to make sense of the information it is receiving, and it is using its knowledge of faces to do so. I have created this illusion accidentally. I was trying to create a Gabor patch and I was trying to add some noise to the image with Gabor coefficients. But I saw a face while I working on it. So I re-designed the code and add into the sorceress :)","title":"28-Pareidolia"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#29-grids2","text":"Above, there are little circles for each corner of the squares.

The idea emerged after reading a paper from (Anstis et al., 2006). After I read this paper, I thought maybe sorceress/Motion: illusion somehow could have a similar effect. So, I added stripes on the background and a line that routed clockwise. Speed and length are constant. The question is do you feel any difference between with background stripes and without background stripes? For me, I feel the line is growing longer when I look at the stripes. Try demo here You can adjust the length and speed of the line.","title":"30-Length"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#31-spirals","text":"Above, there are only 3 different colors, blue, magenta, and green. However, you may see different shades of green. It looks like a Munker illusion. The mechanism of the Munker illusion involves both a color-assimilation effect and a contrast effect (Novick & Kitaoka, 2021). I actually \"translated\" this code from GLSL language into python. But I wish I could do it in a better way since it's a bit slow with heavy math in the background.","title":"31-Spirals"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#32-hypnotic-circles","text":"I inspired this effect from a video by brusspup . However, when I search for the video I found the illusion was actually created by Arthur Shapiro and Alex Rose-Henig unfortunately I couldn't find the original paper. Circles within a larger black circle (actually I coded it into a rectangle). The inner circles in turn seem to form a circular shape that's rolling around the inside of the larger circle. But, believe it or not, the direction that each circle is linear, not circular. You can try the demo here To me, after 5 circles the illusion is starting. Increasing or decreasing the radius of the circles or animation speed didn't affect my perception. However, you can try it and see what happens. ```","title":"32-Hypnotic Circles"},{"location":"explanations%20of%20illusions/#references","text":"Aglioti S, DeSouza JFX, Goodale MA (1995) Size-contrast illusions deceive the eye but not the hand.

JavaScript is a client-side programming language that is commonly used to create interactive elements on web pages. It is particularly well-suited for creating animations that run in a web browser, as it can easily manipulate the HTML and CSS elements on a web page to create dynamic and interactive effects.
