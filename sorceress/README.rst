sorceress 1.8
=============

Purpose of package
------------------

This package‚Äôs purpose is to create optical illusions in a simple way.
The package is written in Python. however, the repo also includes
JavaScript. In
`explanations <https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/explanations%20of%20illusions/>`__
section, you can find the explanations of the illusions.

If you find visual illusions fascinating this package is for you. You
can reproduce the illusions in the literature with a few lines of code.

More importantly, we shouldn‚Äôt take optical illusions as just fun.
Optical illusions help us to research how the visual system of the brain
,which is the most complex mechanism, processes such cues. Most of the
optical illusions in this package are seriously researched in the
neuroscience literature. And I must say that the ‚Äúcausation‚Äù of the most
of effects is still debated in the literature according to my humble
knowledge. Optical illusions are researching not only in human vision
but in other animals. So we can get a lot of insights from an
evolutionary perspective.

In summary, I think this topic is very important, especially in vision
studies.

For all optical illusions check this documentation:
`altunenes.github.io/sorceress/ <https://altunenes.github.io/sorceress/>`__
