Since I thought the JavaScript is more handy then the python when it comes to animations and web deployment, I created
animations in JavaScript.
Currently there are 3 solid illusions that can be seen on the page. But as you can notice, repository has also some other js files.
These are currently at development stage. You can open them in the browser and see the code and feel free to contribute to finish them.

Finished animations :
