# Summary

Optical illusions have long captivated the attention of people and scientists alike, offering a unique opportunity to study the complex workings of the visual system. The popularity of optical illusions on social media also makes it easy to collect a large amount of data for research purposes.

However, the reproduction processes behind many optical illusions can be unclear, making it difficult to fully understand and analyze them. This GitHub repository aims to provide a solution to this issue by offering a collection of tools for creating and manipulating optical illusions with different parameters. This will allow researchers to better study the underlying mechanisms of optical illusions and gain a deeper understanding of the visual system.

# Statement of need

`sorceress` is an Python package for optical illusions. Despite the widespread interest in optical illusions, the lack of clear reproduction processes has hindered their use in scientific research [@Bach:2014]. The code provided in  `sorceress`  fill an important gap by allowing researchers to easily create and manipulate optical illusions with a wide range of parameters. This will enable researchers to study the mechanisms behind optical illusions in greater detail and gain a better understanding of the visual system. The use of these tools will also help to standardize the study of optical illusions, making it easier to compare and contrast the results of different research studies.

`sorceress` was designed to be used by both vision researchers and by students in courses on vision and perception.
